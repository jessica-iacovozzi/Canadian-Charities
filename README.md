This is an Rails 7 API of Canadian charities data(1) scraped from charityintelligence.ca.

(1) Charity columns include name, slogan, city, sector, website, rating, grade, demonstrated_impact and cents_to_cause_ratio.
  - Rating is based on financial transparency, need for funding, grade, demonstrated impact and cents to cause ratio.
  - Grade is based on the charity's public reporting of the work it does and the results it achieves.
  - Demonstrated impact is the impact per dollar calculated from available program information.
  - Cents to cause ratio is the percentage of every dollar donated available for programs, after overhead costs of fundraising and admin/management (excluding surplus).
